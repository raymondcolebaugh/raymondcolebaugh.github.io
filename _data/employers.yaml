            At X2Engine I have been learning to use the Yii Framework to contribute to development
            on a large PHP codebase for an extremely dynamic app, rich with customization. In this
            fast-paced startup environment, I have been able to add a handful of features to the
            X2Engine application, including role-based session timeouts in the RBAC system,
            a generaled CSV import and export code across all modules, an FTP-based
            updater method, and expanded the current cookie-based web tracker to include
            browser fingerprinting capabilities. Recently, I have created the backend for an
            IMAP client, an IP access control list, and a packaging system to import and export
            snapshots of customizations.

            At BareMetal Networks, a Bay Area infosec startup, I have had the opportunity to work
            as an intern Linux sysadmin and Ruby developer. This intership has been an excellent
            experience to test myself and pick up new and exciting technologies at a rapid pace.
            At BareMetal Networks, I worked in a small development team, practicing agile
            development and pair programming in a Ruby envioronment. Some projects I was involved
            in include contributing Ruby code to the intrusion detection system, writing C modules
            to capture network traffic and aggregate statistics, and develop pieces of the Ruby
            on Rails web application.
