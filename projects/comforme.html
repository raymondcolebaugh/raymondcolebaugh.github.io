<p>Community for Me is a web application for finding resources relevant to the communities you identify with. I wrote this web application in Go with a couple of friends during the UCSC Hackathon in 2015, and got to use a collection of technologies including Go, Vagrant, Heroku, Mandrill, and CloudFlare.</p>
