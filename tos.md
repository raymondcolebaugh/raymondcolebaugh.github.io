Information presented on this site is provided as is and without warranty according to public information available at the time. Please let me know if you locate any inaccuracies so that they can be fixed. I write these articles in order to detail software usage and knowledge that I believe can help others learn useful technology and computer science information. If you have any recommendations for useful information you think could help others, please contact me with the contact form on my [About](/about) page.

I may earn a small commission on purchases of products linked to on this site ("Affiliate Links", or "Referral Links"), including the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon products. Other examples of Affiliate Links you find may be for a company's own Referral Program, such as Digital Ocean or Private Internet Access. These links will be clearly marked {% include affiliate-link.html url="/" text="Like This," %} and you can easily search for the same product or remove the URL parameters to avoid providing a commission. If you want to donate to this website, you can use the links to purchase products without any increased cost to your purchase. You can also donate cryptocurrency <a href="bitcoin:{{ site.bitcoin_address }}" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#btc-modal" >here</a> if you'd rather do that. By using these Affiliate Links, I have much more control over the products that are recommended on my site and can ensure only the highest quality products that I have personally vetted are recommended. As such, I **will not** be adding display ads to this site in the future.

Content written for this site is done so using my own time, equipment, and resources, and does not in any way reflect any interactions or information from my past, present, and future employers.

Social sharing icons on this site are provided by the [social-share-urls](https://github.com/bradvin/social-share-urls) GitHub project, which hosts a number of public domain sharing icons, as well as sharing URL schemes and plugin information.
