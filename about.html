I am a recent UC Santa Cruz computer science graduate who is interested in studying
security, intrusion detection, cryptography, high availability, and distributed systems.
I enjoy developing software and building websites with Ruby, PHP, C/C++, Python,
Javascript, and Go, while automating tasks with bash and Puppet and operating
Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS servers on Cisco and Linux networks.
I write my code in vim configured like
[this](https://github.com/raymondcolebaugh/sysadmin-scripts/blob/master/vim2ide.sh"),
and prefer to stay on the command line.
